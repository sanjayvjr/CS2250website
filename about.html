            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I am a Computer Science major at Cal Poly Pomona with a passion for Film. I am a film director and have interests in all the many departments that are needed to make a successful tv show or film. Even though this is my passion, my studies as a Computer Science major pique my interests, and I want to learn more about how I can translate these skills into usables while making films. </p>

            <h2>Favorite Book</h2>
            <p>One of my all-time favorite books is "Christine", written by Stephen King. Being really into film helped me realize the importance of writing and how difficult it is to write a book. What made me particularly love his writing style is the picturization within the descriptions .</p>

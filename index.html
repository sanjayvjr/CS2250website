            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Sanjay Venkatesan, and this is my personal website. There are so many great things I would love to share about myself, including my love for film, music and more. I am from Santa Clara, California in the Bay Area and have moved down to Pomona to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Initally, I started off as a Electrical Engineer, after noticing my interest was waning for the subject, I decided to follow my parents' footsteps into becoming a software engineer. Apart from that, my main passion is film, as of this year I directed my first short film named "The Seasons Club" which I am very proud of. Glad you are visiting the page!</p>
